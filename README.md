## Introduction

Gravitational Teleport is a modern SSH server for remotely accessing clusters
of Linux servers via SSH or HTTPS. It is intended to be used instead of `sshd`.
Teleport enables teams to easily adopt the best SSH practices like:

- No need to distribute keys: Teleport uses certificate-based access with automatic expiration time.
- Enforcement of 2nd factor authentication.
- Cluster introspection: every Teleport node becomes a part of a cluster and is visible on the Web UI.
- Record and replay SSH sessions for knowledge sharing and auditing purposes.
- Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through session sharing.
- Connect to clusters located behind firewalls without direct Internet access via SSH bastions.
- Ability to integrate SSH credentials with your organization identities via OpenID Connect or SAML with endpoints like Okta or Active Directory.
- Keep the full audit log of all SSH sessions within a cluster.

Teleport is built on top of the high-quality [Golang SSH](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh) 
implementation and it is fully compatible with OpenSSH.

## Installing and Running

Download the [latest binary release](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/releases), 
unpack the .tar.gz and run `sudo make install`. This will copy Teleport binaries into 
`/usr/local/bin`.

Then you can run Teleport as a single-node cluster:

```bash
$ sudo teleport start 
```

In production, Teleport must run as root. But to play, just do `chown $USER /var/lib/teleport` and run it under `$USER`, in this case you will not be able to login as someone else though.

## Building Teleport

Teleport source code consists of the actual Teleport daemon binary written in Golang, and also
it has a web UI (located in /web directory) written in Javascript. The WebUI is not changed often
and we keep it checked into Git under `/dist`, so you only need to build Golang:

Make sure you have Golang `v1.8.3` or newer, then run:

```bash
#
# getting & building:
#

$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/gravitational
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/gravitational
$ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.git
$ cd teleport
$ make

#
# Create the default data directory before starting:
#

$ sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/teleport
$ sudo chown $USER /var/lib/teleport
```

If the build was successful the binaries will be placed in 
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/gravitational/teleport/build`

By default the web UI is not build into the binary, to run self-build teleport
you have to set the environment variable: `DEBUG=1`, in debug mode the web UI
will be loaded from [web/dist](web/dist) directory.

Then you can run Teleport as a single-node cluster in development mode: 

```bash
$ DEBUG=1 build/teleport start -d
```

To build the binary with embedded web assets:

```bash
$ make release
$ build/teleport start -d
```

If you want to release your own Teleport version, edit this [Makefile](Makefile), 
update `VERSION` and `SUFFIX` constants, then run `make setver` to update 
[version.go](version.go)

If you want to cut another binary release tarball, run `make release`.

NOTE: The Go compiler is somewhat sensitive to amount of memory: you will need
at least 1GB of virtual memory to compile Teleport. 512MB instance without swap
will not work.

### Rebuilding Web UI

If you want to make changes to the web UI, you have to re-build the content 
of `/dist` directory, see [web/README.md](web/README.md) for instructions on 
how to update the Web UI.

## Why did We Build Teleport?

Mature tech companies with significant infrastructure footprints tend to implement most
of these patterns internally. Teleport allows smaller companies without 
significant in-house SSH expertise to easily adopt them, as well. Teleport comes with an 
accessible Web UI and a very permissive [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/LICENSE)
license to facilitate adoption and use.

Being a complete standalone tool, Teleport can be used as a software library enabling 
trust management in complex multi-cluster, multi-region scenarios across many teams 
within multiple organizations.

The best way to contribute is to create issues or pull requests right here on Github. 
You can also reach the Gravitational team through their [website](https://gravitational.com/)

## Is Teleport Secure and Production Ready?

Teleport has completed several security audits from a nationally recognized
technology security companies. Some of them have been [made public](https://gravitational.com/blog/teleport-release-2-2/). 
We are comfortable with the use of Teleport from a security perspective.

However, Teleport is still a relatively young product so you may experience
usability issues.  We are actively supporting Teleport and addressing any
issues that are submitted to this repo. Ask questions, send pull requests,
report issues and don't be shy! :)

The latest stable Teleport build can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/releases)

## Known Issues

* Teleport does not officially support IPv6 yet.

## Who Built Teleport?

Teleport was created by [Gravitational Inc](https://gravitational.com). We have
built Teleport by borrowing from our previous experiences at Rackspace. It has 
been extracted from [Telekube](https://gravitational.com/product), our
Kubernetes distribution optimized for deploying and remotely controlling complex 
applications into multiple environments _at the same time_:

* Multiple cloud regions
* Colocation 
* Private enterprise clouds located behind firewalls
